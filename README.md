# Face-Mask-Detection

Overview
A deep learning-based face mask detection system that classifies faces as masked or unmasked using VGG16 and OpenCV.

Technologies Used
Python – Scripting and model development
TensorFlow & Keras – Deep learning model training
VGG16 – Pretrained CNN model for feature extraction
OpenCV – Real-time face detection
Image Processing – Preprocessing input images

Features
✔️ Detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not
✔️ Uses VGG16 for accurate classification
✔️ Supports real-time detection via webcam
✔️ OpenCV for face detection and image processing

Installation & Usage
1: Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/raihimanshu444/FaceMask-Detector.git
cd FaceMask-Detector

2: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3: Run the detection script:
python detect_mask.py

Dataset
The model is trained using a dataset of masked and unmasked face images, augmented for better accuracy.

Results
Achieves high accuracy in detecting face masks
Works efficiently in real-time scenarios using OpenCV
